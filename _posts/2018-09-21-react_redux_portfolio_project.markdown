For my React portfolio project I created an event planner web application. Users would be able to create events with set deadlines, and then create tasks with set deadlines for the event. Tasks would have to be checked off before the event day. 

My plan was to have a home page with an About component and Event form component that could display one input at a time. All events would be displayed by the Events component, which would be its own separate page.The user would then be able to click on one of the individual events to view its ‘show’ page, which would have a TaskForm component and a Tasks component.

I had trouble starting out the project, as I wasn’t sure where to begin. The actions, the reducers, the back end, or the components? My understanding of the purpose of mapPropsToState and mapPropsToDispatch was alos lacking. I couldn’t wrap my head around the flow, and this was probably because I still didn’t have a solid grasp around React’s flow and why it worked the way it did. Having to create a project from front to end like this, however, cleared things up about one-fourth in. I think the reason I was having trouble understanding before was because in the react and redux lessons, we were only having to fix specific parts of already created code, and never had to build the whole flow ourselves. Having to create the application myself from scratch helped a lot. I ended up with many more components than initially planned.
