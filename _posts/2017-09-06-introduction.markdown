Indecision. Trying to choose between your passions and what was marketable. Conflicting advice on which way was the right way. Your parents spending a lot of money. You, eventually going with the flow despite your doubts.

I attended Rutgers University and majored in journalism and media, minored in English, and got a certificate in creative writing. I wanted to be a fiction writer, specifically a novelist and/or a children's book writer. Maybe an illustrator, too. I've always been a good creative writer and story-teller, but a major in something like English did not seem to make sense. Journalism was my way of trying to compensate. 

When I told one of my favorite creative writing professors that I was pursuing journalism as a career and planned to write novels on the side, she warned me how doing writing on top of writing could become tiring and that it would probably be better to pursue writing in one way and do something else that doesn't have to do with writing. With all the essays, stories, and news articles I had to do in college, I saw what she meant. Not only that, but while pursuing journalism, I felt I wasn't using my talents to the fullest. Aside from being good at writing, I've also always been a good visual artist and logical. Also, the way journalism paid and how in demand it was always bothered me.


The last year of college, I really started to regret my major, but there was no turning back at this point. While I liked the few feature story and literary journalism assignments I had to do, most of the time I felt like I was forcing myself to do the work. I wasn't sure what I was going to do after college. I no concrete goal, so I lacked motivation.

This was around the time I started looking at other possible career options, and I started to consider web development. I liked how the front-end part of it seemed to encompass logic and visual creativity. I had never thought of web development as a possible career before. It seemed too intimidating, especially when instead of web developer, I'd see it referred to as software engineer. Whenever I came across that title I'd feel a strong force repelling me from my computer screen. Aside from the intimidation, because I also didn't fit the stereotypical image, I never really imagined myself as a potential web developer. But you know what really started to change my view on it?

Unicorns.

When I saw that a web designer/developer hybrid was referred to as a web unicorn, it just made it so much less intimidating. It gave me the strength to start learning what it really was. I took a class at the local college to make sure it was a good fit for me, and it was--I had one of the highest final grades in the the class. I continued to study over the summer with free online resources, and now I'm attending bootcamp.

Following my passion, a concrete goal, a path that's challenging but is where I have some natural aptitude in, I feel so much better. My dream is to become a web designer/developer while working on novels on the side.
