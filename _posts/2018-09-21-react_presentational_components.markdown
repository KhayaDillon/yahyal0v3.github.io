Creating the front end of a website using React was certainly a different experience from what I was use to. For my React Redux portfolio project I went all out in making my pages look stylish. Many of the designs I thought of and implemented where things I thought would go well with React’s structure.

For example, my homepage had three main components that made up it’s body, so I gave each component it’s own background color from colors that compliment each other.

I was also able to create elaborate conditionals in components’ renders. For example, in an index component, rendering the data in different formats depending on the status.

Technically, I guess these are still examples you also do with Ruby erb files, but I think React made it easier. Or at least easier to think about, the way the framework separates things into components.

For instance, creating a loading circle that renders when fetching data and the state’s loading key is true, was definitely something easy to figure out in React’s structure.

Lastly, for one of my forms, I used if else statements and the way React uses event handlers to render form input one at a time. When the user fills out the input and hits enter, it would move onto the next input.
